I am a second year M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering student at [The Ohio State University](https://cse.osu.edu/), 
advised by Prof. [Wei-Lun (Harry) Chao](https://sites.google.com/view/wei-lun-harry-chao). I am broadly interested in Computer Vision
and Machine Learning, and their application to autonomous driving. 

Previously, I received my B.S. degree from [The Ohio State University](https://cse.osu.edu/).
