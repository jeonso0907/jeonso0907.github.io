My name is Sooyoung Jeon and I am a third year M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering student
at [The Ohio State University](https://cse.osu.edu/),
advised by Prof. [Wei-Lun (Harry) Chao](https://sites.google.com/view/wei-lun-harry-chao). 

I am broadly interested in
Computer Vision
and Machine Learning, and their application to autonomous driving and robotics.

Previously, I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering degree from [The Ohio State University](https://cse.osu.edu/).
